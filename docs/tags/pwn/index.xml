      <description>The past 20th of June we had the luck to play the gpnCTF which is a Jeopardy-style Capture The Flag event organized annually by KITCTF, often taking place at the GPN (Goulash Programming Night) conference and also available to play online. This year’s had a fun twist it was based on a Monopoly-style board game, treating challenges like properties to be bought.</description>
